# SecondCSharpClassProject
Project in basic c sharp class where we had to put together a class order form where the student input there name, student number, and email, residency status, the classes they wanted to order, and their credit card information.

The form had to have a running total of all the courses ordered and could not allow the student to have more than 3 courses selected but had to have at least one to complete

Form also had to have a running total of the cost of all the classes and the cost changed depending upon which residency status you selected
